# House Keeper

This is a my pet app to learn the next technologies:

- Gatsby
- GraphQL
- React Native
- Java / Kotlin Spring
- Face Recognition
- Arduino Connection

## The basics Schema is:
- On the website users shows his face via WebCam or upload a photo
- App sends photo and results to the Backend (Spring)
- Springs sends a command to the Arduino
- Arduino launches an Engine and lights the Green Diod for the approved person, and Red Diod / Double-beep for disapproved one

Let's see what will happy there!
